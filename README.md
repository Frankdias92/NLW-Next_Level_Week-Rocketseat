# NLW - Expert 2024


About Next Level Week (NLW) is Rocketseat's largest free hands-on programming event, happening every year.

This year, we had a new feature: you had the opportunity to choose the technology you wanted to learn! You could choose more than one, and the options were: React, React Native, Node, HTML/CSS/JS, Python, Java, and C#.
